Git

Advantages:
* Test changes to code without losing the original (branches)
* Revert back to old versions

Tips
* github.com/new -> to create a new repository

Merge Conflicts
* May occur conflicts
* Happens when we have a different version locally and try to pull another version

>> You can fork a repository, make changes and make a pull request

* Create repository with <username>.github.io
* Create index.html, add, commit and push
* Go to setting in repository
* Click on Pages
